Description: A generalization of the 'Synth' package that is
    designed for data at a more granular level (e.g., micro-level).
    Provides functions to construct weights (including propensity
    score-type weights) and run analyses for synthetic control methods
    with micro- and meso-level data; see Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer
    (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1213634> and Robbins and Davenport
    (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v097.i02>.
