\title{Summarizing microsynth Fits and Results}
\usage{
\method{summary}{microsynth}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{microsynth} object produced by \code{microsynth()}}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The functions \code{print.microsynth} and
\code{summary.microsynth} display information about the microsynth
fit and estimation results, if available.

The output includes two parts: 1) a matching summary that compares
characteristics of the treatment to the synthetic control and the
population; and 2) estimated results, in a similar format as they
appear when saved to .csv or .xlsx., once for each specified
post-intervention evaluation time.
